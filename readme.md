# Josh's Portfolio


## One purpose: To showcase work.

I've attempted to make this page static but active.

## Tools

Made in html and css, background made in blender. The background stops animating when screen reaches smaller sizes. It's a webm so it's pretty small. There's a backup image regardless. Also, if used has 'prefers reduced motion' set, no animations play.
